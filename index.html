            <h1>No Visto A Las 99:99</h1>
            <h3>Album by Alt 4 Javier</h3>
            <h4>No Visto A Las 99:99 info and How it was made:</h4>
            <p>No one hears any sound the same way. Every emotional and intellectual response to a song is a tangled network of deep-seated memories and social pressures. The most banal hook can inexplicably make someone cry (THEORICALLY), a lead sound on top of a kick could trigger, instantly saturate the steps of a dancer (friends and ALL), while another is shaped in that very moment your future emotional response to music.</p>
            <p>This Album carries memories, thoughts and feelings that "Alt 4 Javier" has and presents the possibility of inspiring moments of intense and heartbreaking nostalgia in one listener, and opening new neural pathways towards deep feelings in another.</p>
            <h2>I'm never gonna dance again</h2>
            <h2>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</h2>
            <h2>Though it's easy to pretend</h2>
            <h2>I know you're not a fool</h2>
            <h2>I should have known better than to cheat a friend</h2>
            <h2>And waste a chance that I'd been given</h2>
            <h2>So I'm never gonna dance again</h2>
            <h2>The way I danced with you</h2>

            <h1>Steps To Freedom</h1>
            <h3>Single by Alt 4 Javier - from "No Visto A Las 99:99"</h3>
            <p>The last step for evolution and freedom, is only to learn that everything was learned with blood and sacrifice, traveling with clouds and red sky is nothing more than the speed force that reflects all the madness that you had in that hell, then a metamorphosis arrives that changes from step to step, impenetrable sound against the same, evolving your power and freedom thus giving the same response to the music.</p>
            <p>and again Alt 4 Javier is back with the single "Steps To Freedom" giving a feeling of freedom with traces of hell and with the typical nostalgic melodies, opening a small neural path to deep feelings in another</p>
            <h2>within the speed force,</h2>
            <h2>we are but survivors of madness</h2>
            <h2>freedom against sadness</h2>
            <h2>hate with love</h2>
            <h2>But I'm fine now, this must have meant something to me,</h2>
            <h2>will another technology arrive?</h2>
